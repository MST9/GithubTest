Q1 What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Ans- It creates a git repository from a directory.

Q2 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Ans- Staging area adds file to it without commiting it. I think if you want to commit more than one file then it is useful.

Q3 How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Ans- Whenever their is change in logic add it to staging area and then commit it. In this way their will be one commit per logical change.

Q4 What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Ans- Creating branch could help in way that when you commit changes to branch and run that code and later you found bug you can undo those changes without affecting your main code, if main code is used by some other people. 

Q5 How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Ans- Through diagrams it makes clear what are different branches and in which branch we can commit changes.

Q6 What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Ans- Result whatever changes are there is one branch gets added to another branch. Diagram indicates commits that can be reached. So merging is represented in that manner because both braches can be reached from it.

Q7 What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Ans- Benefit is that we do not need to resolve the conflict. Disadvantage is that it is unable to do comparison which piece of code takes less time memory efficient, so it can arbitarily accept any one code without looking parameters such as memory, run time etc.
