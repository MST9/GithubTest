Q1 How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Ans- Using diff it shows what got removed from previous version by (-) and what got added to new version by (+). This helps in finding out bug by comparing it with previous version.

Q2 How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Ans- By having entire history it helps me to switch to any version, so I don't need to to save with with different names for different changes. It saves time.

Q3 What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Ans- Pros are we can commit according to per logical change.
     Cons are that if we forget we could commit many logical change at once.

Q4 Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Ans- Because they are all part of same repository and they are interconnected so I think multiple files represent one logical change.

Q5 How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Ans- Git log to find commit id and by comparing different ids I can find what has changed in file so as to find how much it changed from previous version.

Q6 How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Ans- I feel confident to revert changes if a bug get introduced.
